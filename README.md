#Mahjong Game for AI

This is the project of our course 60-576. The main goal of this project is to build mahjong platform together with some AI algorithms. After the building finished, we plan to let AIs play together to test which one is best.

For mahjong rules and terms we used, see [here](http://mahjong.wikidot.com/basic-rules). Our implementation may be based on [Chinese Official Mahjong Rule](http://mahjong.wikidot.com/rules:chinese-official-overview). Score Patterns can be found [here](http://mahjong.wikidot.com/rules:chinese-official-scoring).
